# Advent

This repo contains my solutions to adventofcode.com

The code is written to optimize time to solution speed, since I like to try
and compete on the leaderboard. As such the code shouldn't be taken as
examples of code you would want to maintain.

## Emacs

If you are an emacs user, you may be interested in
[advent.el](./advent.el). It contains helper functions to view the problem,
download input and submit an answer all from emacs!
